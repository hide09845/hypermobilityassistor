# The H.A.N.D.
The H.A.N.D. (A.K.A. the Hypermobility Assistance Device) is a combination wrist and knuckle brace that intends to provide a free, open-source, and 3d-printable alternative to the pricey and/or usually under/overeffective wrist braces on the market, while also bracing the rarely-braced knuckle.

# What is the H.A.N.D. made up of?
The H.A.N.D. is composed of four primary parts- the upper plate, the lower plate, the upper cuff, and the lower cuff. 

![An image of the H.A.N.D. Four white arrows are pointing towards the upper plate, lower plate, upper cuff, and lower cuff. The upper plate is the largest of the four parts, appearing as a thin piece that spans a little bit over the knuckle, and connects to the upper cuff via a screw located on the wrist joint, allowing it to rotate in tandem with the wrist. The upper cuff is a semicylinder, with two rectangular "wings" that allow it to connect to the upper plate. The lower cuff is identical to the upper cuff, but with a circle taken out of the area near the wrist joint to allow it to move. The lower cuff is attached to the upper cuff via six rubber bands, with only 3 visible in the image. The lower plate is not directly touching the upper plate, but is connected with four elastic cords, the ends of which have cord stops to allow for adjustable tightness.](https://mayamainvert.neocities.org/hand2.jpg)

They will be referred to as such for the remainder of this document.

# What does it excel at?
The H.A.N.D. mechanically limits the rotation of your wrist both vertically and horizontally, reducing your wrist's mobility to approximately that of the average person. This is particularly useful for fine motor activities such as writing or drawing, as well as any activity that requires a large amount of wrist movement. This offloads much of the muscular usage required to keep your joints from overextending to the device, reducing the pain and fatigue caused by fine motor activities.

The H.A.N.D. will help reduce pain from typing. However. it limits horizontal movement of the wrist to the wiggle room of the device (and the lower plate may interact with the keyboard unless you are typing with your hands raised), which can make typing awkward in some positions.

# Warnings
Do not eat while wearing the H.A.N.D.. Like all other 3d-printed goods, pieces of food and dirt can get stuck in the grooves of the print. The H.A.N.D. may alleviate pain while eating with silverware, but it will pose an actual danger to your health. 

Do not lick the H.A.N.D. or place your mouth on it. Again, dirt and bacteria WILL get stuck in the grooves of the print, and you WILL be at risk of illness.

# How to scale the H.A.N.D. in your software
Note: The upper plate, upper cuff, and lower cuff MUST be scaled with each other without any stretching. The lower plate can be whatever size fits your palm, as long as the cord/string/wire you use to connect it to the upper plate fits both sets of holes. 

What you need (aside from the main pieces)

- Two screws and two nuts, the size is determined by how much/whether you scaled the device. Measure the hole attached to the wings of the upper cuff to figure out the screw and nut size.
- A sheet of padding of a thickness that you decide
- Cord/string/wire of your choice, preferably elastic, and four cord stops for adjustability
- Six rubber bands of a reasonable size (they can be double wrapped to shorten them)

Measure your hand from the base of the metacarpus to the edge of your knuckle. The upper plate should extend about 1.5-2cm past your knuckle, but don't worry too much as long as it braces your knuckle joint. If it's correctly calibrated, your knuckle shouldn't be able to hyperextend more than 15+-5 degrees without extensive effort.

Place the wings of the upper plate through the wings of the upper cuff so the holes match, then slot the two screws in outwards (such that if you screwed the nuts on, they would face outward). Then, screw the nuts on. 

After this, cut your cord into two long pieces. You can trim it down later, or just leave it long. Slot the cord through the holes in the lower plate (two holes per cord). Pretty much any configuration would work, but I have it slotted through like so:

After this, you're going to want to place one end of the cord into each hole of the upper plate, then attach your cord stops.

Then, double wrap the 6 rubber bands and place them onto the little protruding bits on the upper and lower cuff such that it would hold the cuff together. You're gonna want to put your wrist in now to see what thickness of padding you'll need.

Finally, you will want to attach your padding to the upper and lower cuff. You can cut it out and just superglue or hot glue it, but make sure that it fits first by putting it in unadhered, maybe wear it around a bit. If it falls out, it's too loose, if it crushes your wrist/cuts off bloodflow at all you may want to get a different thickness of padding.

# Disclaimers

- I am only uploading the H.A.N.D.. The H.A.N.D. was designed by a team of two, including myself. 
- The H.A.N.D. is a prototype that was designed around my wrist and hand. It may not fit perfectly on all bodies. 
- Do not wear the H.A.N.D. if you are experiencing any pain caused by it. 
- If the H.A.N.D. results in any injury, contact me (mayamainvert@proton.me) so I can place a disclaimer and/or update the STL. If it cuts the skin, disinfect the wound then file/sand down the area that resulted in a cut. It shouldn't be able to cut you, but some people have more sensitive skin than me and I don't exactly have a broad sample set.
